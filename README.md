# Machine-Learning-Mathematical-Theory
Here are the notes I created, regarding mathematical thoery of each machine learning algorithm. If you don't understand why and how those basic algorithms work, please go through these notes.
These notes are easy understanding for beginners with some Linear A. If you still don't understand the terms in my notes, please don't worry and check them online. Once you understand them, you will be fine.
You can do it!
